# This little script generates the 'expected' output for mapdb-related tests.
# The following modifications are done:
#  - CRLF line endings are converted to LF
#  - Lines beginning with '[DONTCHECK]' are removed and thus not checked.
#  - Lines beginning with 'MDB:' are removed and thus not checked.
#  - The characters '*', '+', '[', ']' are quoted.
#  - Trailing spaces are removed.
#  - At the begin of each line, '.*' is inserted.
# Only content between 'KUT TAP TEST START' and 'KUT TAP TEST FINISHED' is
# considered.
